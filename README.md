### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Security Research Engineer with [Elastic](https://elastic.co). I research adversary tradecraft in order to develop [detections](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules) and help defenders protect their organization.

You can find some of my contributions to the information security community [here](https://github.com/threat-punter/community-contributions).

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/threatpunter) and [Medium](https://medium.com/threatpunter)
