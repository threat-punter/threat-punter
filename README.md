### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Your data is one of your most valuable assets â€” the better you protect it from attack, the better your reputation will be with discerning customers. I'm a Staff Security Engineer, specialized in Detection Engineering and Security Operations â€” I defend organizations against attacks and protect their data and customers from damage and loss.

You can find some of my contributions to the information security community [here](https://github.com/threat-punter/community-contributions).

I've publised extensive research and examples for implementing Detection-as-Code. I'm the creator of [Dorothy](https://github.com/threat-punter/dorothy) â€” a tool to help security teams test their monitoring and detection capabilities for their Okta environment. I presented Dorothy at Black Hat USA.
