### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Your data is one of your most valuable assets â€” the better you protect it from attack, the better your reputation will be with discerning customers. I'm a Lead Detection & Response Engineer, Threat Hunter, and Threat Researcher â€” I defend organizations against cyber threats and protect their data and customers from damage and loss.

I'm the creator and maintainer of [Dorothy](https://github.com/threat-punter/dorothy) â€” a tool to help security teams test their monitoring and detection capabilities for their Okta environment. I presented Dorothy at Black Hat USA.

You can find some of my contributions to the information security community [here](https://github.com/threat-punter/community-contributions).
